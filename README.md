## How does species richness vary in native restored prairies when NPK fertilizer treatments are applied

## Abstract
The Minnesota State University of Moorhead Regional Science Center has two established restored prairie sites: North Pond and Houston. Students at MSUM have collected 5 years of percent cover data from North Pond and 3 years from Houston. We will be using these data sets to ask “How does species richness vary in native restored prairies when NPK fertilizer treatments are applied?” We will be using exploratory data analysis to pursue this question by comparing percent cover and taxa data from both sites to look at the variation of species richness. Previous studies on native and restored prairies have shown that anthropogenic influences on the environment fuel the growth of invasive species (MacDougall et al. 2014). We expect to find that plots with applied NPK fertilizer will have a lower overall species richness than plots with no nutrients applied. A greater understanding of these processes and consequent environmental impacts may provide a useful background of knowledge for land management, restoration, and conservational efforts. 

## Introduction
The Nutrient Network (NutNet) is a global research collaborative started by the University of Minnesota (U of M) with the intent to study the effects of nutrient deposition in grasslands asking this main research question: How are the productivity and diversity of plant species impacted by the addition of nutrients? MSUM is in its sixth year of enrollment with the network, as we established a NutNet site at the MSUM Regional Science Center (RSC). This site, called North Pond (NP), is located on an older prairie restoration. We are required to follow the research protocols as outlined by the network and submit our data to the U of M. 

The Houston site was originally intended to be enrolled in the network as our second location, but the decision was made to not enroll it due to the results that we have seen at North Pond. The concern was that nutrient additives of NPK would fuel the growth of invasive species and disrupt the development of this prairie restoration. Instead, we are using Houston for independent student research projects. Research projects that will be conducted this year include:
eDNA metabarcoding 
Focal species morphology across three sites
Dormant vs. non-dormant lead plant seeding 
Analyzing and mapping species diversity

## Methods
According to NutNet protocols (Nutrient Network 2016), each NutNet site is split into three blocks, each with 10 5x5 m plots for a total of 30 plots. Factorial combinations of nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium - NPK) were added for the fifth year to designated 5x5 m plots in the spring. The Houston site follows the same protocols for 5x5 m plot design as well, but does not receive the fertilizer treatment. We measured species diversity and species abundance using NutNet protocols for both sites (Nutrient Network 2016):

Percent cover of each plant species was recorded within a 1-2 m subplot in each plot at both sites as a measure of species diversity and abundance

Data analysis was completed using R Studio software. 

## Results

Fig. 1 Comparison of plant species richness between untreated plots, Houston (left) and NPK treated plots, North Pond (right). 

Our results (Fig. 1) show a greater consistency between control plots than seen in N,P,K plots. At North Pond, the plot with the greatest species richness was control plot 9, which had a total of 14 species in the 1 meter square sampling area. Some of the plots with the least amount of species richness were plots with all three NPK treatments applied. These plots contained 5 different species- with roughly 50% consisting of invasive species. 

However, att Houston, there were 7 plots with the same species richness of 5 species in the 1 meter square sampling subplot. Three of these plots contained only native species, and the other four only contained a single invasive species. This suggests that control plots, even when they contain a lower species richness, have a lower presence of invasive species than NPK plots. This supports the study mentioned in the abstract- that anthropogenic influences on the environment increase the growth of invasive species (Macdougall et al. 2014).

## Discussion
Nutrient deposition and runoff often contaminate the surrounding area of application. A study completed on the effects of urbanization on species richness showed that under circumstances of urbanization, species richness almost always decreases (McKinney 2008). This, paired with our results that have shown a higher average species richness in control plots as compared to plots with NPK additives, could implicate that as urban growth and sprawl increase, we will see a decrease of native species richness as more land is maintained with chemical control including fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. There is also evidence that suggests that the use of NPK fertilizers could increase the amount of exotic species richness, thus decreasisng the number of native species richness in prairie landscapes (Seableem 2013).

This result is often misinterpreted, as fertilizers have a tendency to increase biomass. This creates the illusion that there is a healthy environment because there is more plant matter, but an analysis of species richness will often times reveal that, as we have seen in our work at the MSUM RSC, chemicals decrease species richness.
